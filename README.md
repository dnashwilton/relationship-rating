## Testing

### Manual Testing

The website was continually updated as it was developed. I tried to use the dev tools while using Code Institute’s gitpod on Chrome. It would not be successful each time, as I had to change the password each time I tried to use Chrome.

The only time I was successful was when I copied and pasted the html and css code onto the html and css sheets on Visual Studio 2022 and saved everything. I right-clicked the index.html and deployed Chrome, Opera and Firefox.

Website tested in Firefox, Opera, Edge and Chrome.

<br>

### Validation Testing

HTML - No errors found on https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea

CSS - No errors found on https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator

JavaScript - No errors found on https://jshint.com/

During the development of the website, I always had a local copy of the website I could refer to when needed. When issues arose, I looked through books on HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I also asked people on Slack and they helped me.

I could not confirm that the website was working correctly on an iPhone or tablet needed for the course. I have a Galaxy Tab and phone. The website on my tablet and phone reacts the same as when I simulate the tablet and iPhone on the laptop.

## Credits

### Content

The basic setup of the quiz was taken from codexplained whch wasrecommended by the tutor section of Code Institute twice. The quiz began with me trying to do a multiple-answer quiz and make the code my own. I could not achieve the correct outlook for the quiz. I asked the tutor section, and they guided me to the quiz mentioned above. Since JavaScript is hard for me to do at this time, I downloaded the code and tried to change it enough for the assessment section of Code Institute.
I am trying to achieve something different with the code by using a switch statement. If it does not work at the time of handing the project in, then I will be looking at the project fully once I am able to do so.

<br>

## Code

<br>

The resources that were used in the project:

Sams TeachYourself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (THIRD EDITION)

Mike McGrath HTML, CSS & JavaScript (Special Edition)

My thanks to my mentor Martina for the help and encouragement she gave me while I was developing this project. My thanks to Matthew Shepherd and Andy Guttridge on Slack.
