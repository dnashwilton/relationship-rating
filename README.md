## Testing

### Manual Testing

The website was continually updated as it was developed. I tried to use the dev tools while using Code Institute’s gitpod on Chrome. It would not be successful each time, as I had to change the password each time I tried to use Chrome.

The only time I was successful was when I copied and pasted the html and css code onto the html and css sheets on Visual Studio 2022 and saved everything. I right-clicked the index.html and deployed Chrome, Opera and Firefox.

Tested the comments page with and without inputs in all fields.

Tested all links on all pages.

Verified the comments form is unable to be submitted with the required information (Name, Email, radio buttons and checkboxs clicked and the comments section).

Website tested in Firefox, Opera, Edge and Chrome.

Validation Testing

HTML

Some errors were found but corrected while on the official W3C Validator.
CSS

One error was found but corrected while on the official (Jigsaw) Validator.
Bugs
Earlier in the testing phase, I found that was found in the correct place but was not. I found was below

. When I switched them to their correct alignment, W3C Validator passed the code.
I slipped a piece of code into the css sheet and commit it. I realised what happened and corrected the error. W3C css validator caught a missing '}'. I relplaced the '}' and the error was corrected.

During the development of the website, I always had a local copy of the website I could refer to when needed. When issues arose, I looked through books on HTML and CSS to confirm ideas I knew could correct the problem or take the suggestions in the books so that the website would function better and the coding would be easy to read.

I could not confirm that the website was working correctly on an iPhone or tablet needed for the course. I have a Galaxy Tab and phone. The website on my tablet and phone reacts the same as when I simulate the tablet and iPhone on the laptop.

## Credits

### Content

The basic setup of the pages was based on the websites of the National Trust, Wakehurst Place and Kew Gardens. As I based the project on Wakehurst Place, I looked at their website more. I chose a forest pallet with the colours of the different species of trees and sky.

The navigation and footer style of coding I took from Love Running and Percipio. Percipio was the website I was learning from before beginning the course with Code Institute.

## Media
The images on the Early History and History of the Mansion are from Google images. The images and MP4's on the other pages are mine. These were taken on a Pentax K70 with 18-55mm and 55-200mm zoom lens and 50mm prime lens.

## Code
The resources that were used in the project:


Sams TeachYourself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (THIRD EDITION)


Mike McGrath HTML, CSS & JavaScript (Special Edition)


All photos and mp4's are mine except for images on pre-history.html and mansion.html. Saved my photos and mp4's on https://dnashwilton.imgur.com/all/, onedrive, C://, usb and portable harddrives.


I have taken some of the text from Wakehurst, Kew Gardens and various sources from Goggle. I have then rewritten some of the information in my own words. I have run the documentation through the microsoft editor for word 365 and grammerly and found that a small percentage is in the text.


My thanks to my mentor Martina for the help and encouragement she gave me while I was developing this project.
